## Register a component

### Summary
Tell bower how to find your component so others can use it as well.
To register a new package you must comply with the following:
- The package name must adhere to the bower.json spec.
- There must be a valid bower.json in the projectâ€™s root directory.
- Your package should use [semver](http://semver.org/) Git tags. The v prefix is allowed.
- Your package must be publicly available at a Git endpoint (e.g., GitHub).
- For private packages (e.g. GitHub Enterprise), please consider running a private Bower registry.

### Syntax
```bash
bower install <package-name> <git-endpoint>
```
